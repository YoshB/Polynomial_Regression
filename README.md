A polynomial regression itÂ´s a model that consist in find a polynomio of 'n' degree with a dependent variable (x), for which the values of the 
independent variable (y) gives values as close as possiblo to our Data, this is an iterative processs because, according with the polynomio
degree, the coefficients of the polinomio must be readjusted in each iteration.

I decided some degree for each one of these examples but I encorage you to find a degree (n) that could fit better with the data files in this
repo.
